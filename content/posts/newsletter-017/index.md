Welcome to the 17th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [Way of Rhea has a Discord!][wor-discord]

![New Way of Rhea assets](way-of-rhea.gif)
_Updated visuals for interactive items._

[Way of Rhea][wor-website] is a puzzle platformer that takes place in a world
where you can only interact with objects that match your current color. The game
is being developed in a custom built Rust game engine and hot swappable
scripting language.

This month's updates:

- More progress has been made on the hub world! The game is no longer fully
  linear.
- All interactive elements are getting a visual update, pictured above.
- The devs have created [a Discord server][wor-discord] where you can hang out,
  stay up to date on the latest developments, and if you're interested, chat
  about the implementation (see the `#tech` channel.)

### [Cheese]

_Pew pew!_

[Cheese] is a small Real Time Strategy game created for the
[GitHub Game Off 2020]. It was written using a 'low-level gamedev stack'
consisting of:

- [wgpu-rs] for rendering,
- [gltf] models,
- [wgpu_glyph] for text rendering
- [legion] for ECS
- and [lyon_tessellation] for rendering 2D UI elements.

The game is in a finished state, but it would be relatively easy to add new
features such as unit types and buildings.
